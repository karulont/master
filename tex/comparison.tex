\section{Comparison}
There was an alternative integer programming model developed for exact same
problem, using the same simplifications and assumptions described
in~\autoref{sec:discrete problem}. The alternative model has a lots of more
variables. With more variables it is possible use simpler constraints, which
contain variables from non consecutive timesteps. To be more precise,
constraints only use the variables from the current timestep $t$ and from the
next timestep $t+1$.

The objective function for alternative model is a mix between progressive
energy minimization like~\eqref{eq:objective} and minimizing the time when node
statuses different. I guess there could be some problems similar to the problem
depicted in~\autoref{apx:movement}. Terminal state is fixed with a large cost,
when it differs in the last timestep. The objective function only considers the
location of cars and not the robots just like the model described
in~\autoref{sec:model}.

\subsection{Problem instances used for comparison}
The underlying grid layout was taken from a real car park. Initial and terminal
configurations were randomly generated.

\subsection{Testing platform}
The testing was done a machine with Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790K CPU.  The
machine has 16GB of operating memory. With hyper-threading the number of
virtual CPUs available was 8. However, the solvers were instructed to use only
thread, because several instances were run in parallel.

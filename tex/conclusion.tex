\section{Conclusions}

Integer programming model for optimizing a specific automated valet parking systam was derived. The model was tested with different test cases, 
for which it was able to find an optimal solution. 

Different integer programming models that are used to solve a same problem are known to have wildly different running times that are hard to predict.
The performance of the current model was lower then the comparison that it was benchmarked against. One plausible way to try to improve it would be to try to 
limit the total number of variables in the model by combining them into single variable with a wider range for the solver. 
This integer programming model could be used to validate future heuristical solvers for the same problem, for example any deep learning approaches.

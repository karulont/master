\section{Conclusions}
Integer programming model for optimizing a specific automated valet parking
system was derived. The model was tested with different problem instances. Some
instances revealed problems with the objective function used. Several slightly
different objective functions were proposed and field tested on problem
instances.

Different integer programming models that are used to solve a same problem are
known to have wildly different running times that are hard to predict. The
performance of the current model was lower then the comparison that it was
benchmarked against. One plausible way to try to improve it would be to come up
with a novel way how to encode various states and constraints needed to still
represent the same automated valet parking problem.

To really solve the full automated valet parking problem, we need to deal with
real-time requirements, which currently are infeasible for the integer
programming models compared here. We believe that

\subsubsection{Canonical form of LP}
\begin{align*}
    &\max c^T \cdot x\\
    &Ax \leq b\\
    &x \geq 0
\end{align*}
\subsubsection{Dual of it}

\begin{align*}
    &\min y^T \cdot b\\
    &y^TA \geq c^T \quad (A^ty \leq c)\\
    &y \geq 0
\end{align*}

\subsubsection{Weak duality theorem}
\begin{theorem}
Primal LP optimum $\leq$ Dual LP optimum
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    For any feasible vector $x$ and for any feasible vector $y$, we show that $c^Tx
    \leq y^Tb$. Because $x$ is feasible we have $Ax \leq b$. Because $y \geq 0$, we
    get that 
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:wdt_1}
    y^TAx \leq y^Tb.
\end{align}
   We also have that $y^TA \geq c^T$. Since $x \geq 0$:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:wdt_2}
    y^TAx \geq c^Tx.
\end{align}
By combining (\ref{eq:wdt_1}) and (\ref{eq:wdt_2}) we get that $c^Tx \leq y^Tb$. Because
this holds for any feasible $x$ and $y$ we get that $\max c^Tx \leq \min y^Tb$.

\end{proof}
\subsubsection{Strong duality}
\begin{theorem}
    There are a few possibilities.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Both primal and dual problems are infeasible.
        \item The primal problem is infeasible and the dual is unbounded.
        \item The primal problem is unbounded and the dual is infeasible.
        \item Both primal and dual problems have feasible solutions and their optimum
            values are equal.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

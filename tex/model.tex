\subsection{Variables}
The variables for the model are all binary, meaning their allowed values are from the set
$\{0,1\}$. There are three groups of variables:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item node status variables,
    \item edge occupied variables,
    \item decision variables.
\end{enumerate}
For every timestep, there is another layer of the variables. Meaning that if
we have $n$ variables for timestep $0$, and we have $t$ timesteps, then in total
there will be $tn$ variables in the model. In the variable indexing, the
timestep is the always the last index.

\subsubsection{Node status variables}
As specified in \autoref{sec:discrete problem}, there are many possible statuses
for parking spots. Node status variables are meant to encode the node status.
There is a variable for every combination of node, status and timestep. To be
more accurate, the group of node status variables is defined as
\begin{align}
    &\forall v \in \V: \forall w \in \W: \forall t \in \T: & \nstat_{v,w,t}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Edge occupied variables}
There are variables for each directed edge between parking spots. When a robot
moves from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$ at timestep $t$, the edge variable
$\occu_{(u,v),t}$ is 1 to indicate that the edge is occupied. All edge variables
are defined as
\begin{align}
    &\forall e \in \E: \forall t \in \T: & \occu_{e,t}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Decision variables}
This is the most important group of variables, because they represent the
decisions or actions, that the model should find. The decision variables are
\begin{align}
    &\forall v \in \V: \forall w \in \Wm: \forall d \in \D: \forall t \in \T: &
    \go_{v,w,d,t}\\
    &\forall v \in \V: \forall w \in \Wm: \forall d \in \D: \forall t \in \T: &
    \cont_{v,w,d,t}\\
    &\forall v \in \V: \forall w \in \Wm: \forall d \in \D: \forall t \in \T: &
    \stp_{v,w,d,t}\\
    &\forall v \in \V: \forall w \in \Wl: \forall t \in \T: &
    \lift_{v,w,d,t}\\
    &\forall v \in \V: \forall w \in \Wd: \forall t \in \T: &
    \drop_{v,w,d,t}
\end{align}
Decision variable is set to 1, iff that action is taken the specified node, with
specified node status, and at specified timestep. For movement variables:
$\go_{v,w,d,t}$, $\cont_{v,w,d,t}$ and $\stp_{v,w,d,t}$ also the direction is
specified. Decision variables already have self-describing names, but to
clarify, we explain them one-by-one in~\autoref{tbl:decvars}.
